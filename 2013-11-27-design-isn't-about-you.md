## Design isn't about you


So this one day I was speaking to some friends of mine and something weird came up. One particular thing that my friend said struck a nerve with me and that was *" Sorry, UXMonkey, you'll never feel what every little boy in India feels when he watches Sachin Tendulkar bat."*
 
This was on the eve of Sachin's retirement and they were obviously sentimental but I immediately started arguing with him that it didn't matter what the gender of the person was and even though he did not mean it literally, every boy or man in India did not necessarily idolize Sachin as he did. His retort was quick too " Those who claim not to like him are wannabes." . It was then I realised that my friend would never make a good user experience designer.(Yes, I almost always put things to perspective no matter whatever happens with a UX angle.)
 
The reason is simple and clear, my friend never even attempted to understand that people are different in their choices and  that they need not necessarily have the same or even similar tastes as us. This is one of the most important things that a designer needs to memorize and burn it in their minds. ***Design isn't about you.***
 
I'll spare you the details and say that I won that arguement even though another mutual friend jumped in to support this friend of mine. My side of the arguement was simple, what people feel when they see something or someone is unique to them and it cannot be compared to others. People are different and unless we understand that, we cannot design things for them.
 
The key to being a good uxer is to understand and develop a mentality that not everyone has the same behaviour pattern, choice, taste and understanding ways and they are correct in their own sense. This helps us then understand the users better and design better.
 
Until Laters,
 
The UXmonkey
