## Icecream and UX

Yesterday while I was driving back home, I was waiting at a red light when I saw a Naturals Icecream Parlour at the corner of the cross road and decided to buy a tub of icecream. Naturals is a famous brand in India which produces flavours of icecream that are fruit based and have no preservatives. The icecream is expensive as compared to your natural run of the mill, mass produced icecream because of the natural ingredients and the fact that the icecream is never more than a week old. I grabbed myself a custard apple tub and came home.
 
 
While I was devouring the heavenly icecream, I started concocting ideas how this was about good user experience. So I will list them here.
 
 ***Flavour and Taste*** - The first thing that hit me as I had my first spoon was this icecream was melting in my mouth to give a rich creamy fruit flavour that was almost akin to eating a custard apple, only this was better. It gave me what I expected and in a way that was enjoyable for me and that was my first lesson for UX. Users come to our websites with a specific action in mind, they are looking to buy something, or pay their bills, or find some information. In the icecream, I was looking for rich, delightful taste and I got what I want. Now I wanna buy more. So if we give the users what they want, they will return.
 
***Different Variety of  Flavours*** - Naturals people seems to have done a lot of research on it's consumers before making different flavours of icecream. They use natural fruit bits too. They bring in seasonal flavours and keep mixing it up, except for a few regulars. This draws from the innate human nature that craves change. While I can always buy my favourite Tender Coconut or Custard Apple, I can also go in for seasonal flavour like Jambul if I feel bored with my regulars. However I have never gone into Naturals and seen a complete 180 deg change in their menu. Similarly in providing an enjoyable user experience for users, we need to keep constantly changing certain elements that piques their curiosity and helps them learn something new. However users feel comfortable in familiarity which is why drastically changing everything might not be a good idea.
 
***Texture*** - Naturals Icecreams are great because they never have that occasional ice crystal. The texture of the icecream is consistent and very creamy. Consistency is a good usability heuristic, If I buy an icecream from a brand and do not find consistency in the flavours each time, I would brand it as unreliable. It's the same with web pages, my first impression with an inconsistent website is always " These people do not know their stuff."
 
***Packaging*** - Naturals has no fancy boxes and cutesy crap on it, a plain box with a sticker containing the photo of the fruit, the icecream is made of. Simple, clean and to the point. The number of times I've heard of "Look and Feel" when coming to discussing websites is too much. I agree that it matters but when someone tells me, "make this look pretty", I feel like asking them, should I put makeup on it? Websites are not meant to prefer looking beautiful over functionality. Most people describe the websites they want in terms of how it looks and not what it does, my advice? Be like Naturals, simple and to the point. Work on building an audience through content and not looks.
 
Well these are the four things Icecream teaches me about UX, Sound off what you feel in the comments
