## UX of Products, an introduction

Everyone these days is catching up on UX. It is a hot buzz word in the tech industry and others too. However, what people don't realise is that UX is not a fancy term that relates to User Interfaces. It is not just coming up with some sketches and building wireframes, UX is in everything. UXofproducts is my attempt to clear the air on UX with examples. I'm going to review the user experience of various products. These products will be reviewed based on overall ease of use, adherence to heuristics, the information architecture, interaction designs, typography, visual language and design. I might conduct user testing of these products too 
whenever I can find some time and users to see how these products fare not just from my perspective. 

I will also be blogging about User experience in design in general so feel free to surf while you're here if you want to read my take on it.

Who am I? I am a UX designer, a problem solver and I am here to show you how everything you work with has a certain good or bad experience to it. I will give these products a rating depending on a combination of my experience and usability testings results, however each product is experienced differently by people so take this with a pinch of salt and try them out yourselves. I'd love to hear about how your experience was!
