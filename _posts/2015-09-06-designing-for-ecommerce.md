## Designing for e-Commerce

E-Commerce is now a day to day term in the lives of people. In the past five years e-Commerce globally has moved leaps and bounds between selling books and clothing online to selling grocery and even expensive and niche items such as art and jewellery and even services online. With a wide range of products and services playing a myriad of roles in an individual’s life, Let’s look at how we should be designing for e-Commerce applications.

**One size does not fit all**

The key thing to understand is that, when it comes to e-Commerce, there is no one type or pattern that fits all types. While we may have transferred the process online, one has to understand that shopping for groceries is not the same as shopping for art or jewellery no matter in the real or the virtual world, hence we need to understand the motivations of the user and design accordingly. 

**Understand the user mindset**

Users do not have the same perception when it comes to various products and services. Buying clothing online is not the same as buying books or grocery items. Grocery items are seen as a need or a must have which needs replenishing every few days where as clothing is seen as an occasional affair, Art and jewellery are mostly seen as a one time investment. The user sees luxury items as an investment and such purchases are usually done in deliberation, where as purchase of food, books, clothing is sometimes impulsive. 

Clothing and accessories are most purchased for their brand, quality and durability. Books are most purchased for the content value and the reviews they have received. Grocery is purchased for its quality, shelf life, taste and so on. Understanding the value the user attaches to the products helps us design for them better. 


**Understand the product offering**

Firstly, when designing an e-commerce application, in order to provide a great experience it is important that we understand the product first. Product offerings affect user’s shopping behaviour especially online where the products are not tangible. Users are mostly skeptical expensive buying items such as a diamond necklace online where are they are comfortable buying a watch from the same site. Understanding the product helps us cater to the user in a better way by going an extra mile to help address their concerns.

Secondly, once we've understood the product offering, we can work cohesively to understand what is the best way to present the product to the user that might clearly grab their attention and help them make the purchase decision faster.


**Customisation and Personalisation**

Between the great debate of customisation versus personalisation, designers need to understand that these are not mutually exclusive to each other. When it comes to e-Commerce, both customisation and personalisation hold their own importance. It is highly important to customise the experience based on the product offering, the user perception about the product and the mindset of the user while buying the product. 

When it came to designing for an art based market place, we had to customise the way we presented artwork. This was quite unlike any other type of e-commerce store, we came up with features such as view in room settings where the user could view and compare an artwork in various settings and also compare two artworks in the same room. This helps us capture the user’s attention and helps them understand the product before purchase. 

For another e-commerce project we brought in virtual try on options that helped user view then and there how the product experience would be by simulating it. 

These customisations help build a robust site that provides users a great experience and helps them purchase better. 

Personalisation is more adaptive in nature. In this type of design, a feature adapts itself based on the knowledge already available. The idea behind this is to tailor the experience starting from the time the user first uses the website/ app.  Understanding the browsing and purchase history to help recommend similar products or differentiated products, provide special offers builds brand loyalty by providing a unified pleasant experience. 

**Removing the bottlenecks**

When designing a system that provides an extensive amount of offerings it is paramount that bottlenecks to purchasing an item must be removed and the experience must be made as smooth as possible. Some of the bottle necks that users encounter that hamper their shopping experience are,

- Providing too many options in one view - Usually users see choice as good and want more options while purchasing however, e-commerce sites sometimes go overboard with the amount of choices offered at once and there by confuse the user with too many choices, it is advisable to keep the options to an optimal number to reduce the number of bounces.

- Non linear Checkout processes -  Multiple steps and redirections during the checkout confuses users and alienates them from the website. The checkout process should be simple and easy for the user to understand and also reinforce security provided in the payment page so that the user can easily purchase the product.

- No information about the company - Most users trust a brand they know and hence it is very important for the user to know about the company they are dealing with. This not only builds trust but also helps create brand identity in the long run.

- Not providing a robust search engine - Many a times users don’t know the exact thing they are looking for and would like to use search instead of sifting through product categories. A robust search engine with filtering options will help the user find their product of choice easier and makes them more likely to buy the product. 


By removing some of these bottlenecks we ensure that the user has a pleasant experience.


While there are more subtleties that need to be addressed when designing for e-Commerce, these are some of the key areas that when kept in mind while designing will help the designer and the company offer a pleasant meaningful experience and go a long way in building a loyal customer base.
