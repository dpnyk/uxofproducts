## User Experience by Generation

I came across this **Kids React** video and it got me wondering, how is it that when I was 8, I was able to use this very same gameboy without any prior knowledge or even having seen such a device before( Gameboy was a gift from my uncle who'd got it for us from abroad) while these tech savvy kids fail to operate a much simpler device. 

These kids from a first world country with so much access to technology, yet most of them were struggling to use it. Has it dumbed them down? Then it flashed that, these kids were not dumb, their intuitive orientation are towards the gadgets of today. 

We have come such a long way in providing improved user experience that everything older seems too tedious. In an age when response is expected in split seconds, devices which are big but not bulky, it's but natural that old school devices are only meant for nostalgia and 90s kids phrases but that does not make them bad technology. It makes them a time machine, something that puts everyone back to where it all began. 

It's endlessly fascinating to watch these kids look at it with a myriad of expressions. 
Some kids recognised them instantly, One child had the console, a kid's dad had the console. One asked a very good question - "You don't just turn it on and get the game?" There we have it! We've reduced so many steps in a gaming device that an old school gaming device makes no sense when you know you've to put extra effort. Pressing start did not start the console! It had a button on top ( major heuristic mistake!).  You needed additional accessories just to be able to play at any time of the day. Other initial struggles included no re-chargeable batteries, no wall adapter coming along with the console great marketing ploy though). 

That it sold 64 million consoles definitely tells us that it was highly popular and usable.This is because users were delighted with it, User Experience is all about creating delight and in that sense the gameboy had excellent UX for it's generation. So what makes for great user experience is the time factor and the context.

These days we design interfaces for people to interact and yet after a while, the content gets too old and obsolete, the trends in design change and the general perception changes. What once was a delightful experience now becomes a tedious chore. Gameboy's been no different but the kids got it right though, Gameboy was a revolutionary device and a milestone in the industry of gaming devices.

On the contrary,

The reaction of **Elders React**  to google glass was not too dissimilar. Most people got how it's put wrong. One person confused it for hearing aid but some had heard of it. The kids wanted no switch on button where as the adults scrambled to look for it. Plain speaking to the device seemed very abnormal to them. One lady particularly mentioned she did not like it, some commented that it would be a pain to use on the street and that smartphones already were hated enough. It was uncomfortable to wear all day long and could cause accidents while driving. Privacy issues were also highlighted.

But the key thing, Majority of either group did not want the devices presented to them, which only shows that User Experience is a whole lot about context and Time than previously thought.

Until Laters,
The UX Monkey
