          <p>Everyone these days is catching up on UX. It is a hot buzz word in the tech industry and others too. However, what people don't realise is that UX is not UI, UX is in everything. UXofproducts is my attempt to clear the air on UX with examples. For now I am going to review the experience of products I buy. Ranging from Organic seeds I purchased just a couple days ago to beauty products, clothes, shoes,accessories, implements, kitchen items etc. I will write about almost everything I purchased, along with the experience of buying it, the product itself and support if it applies. </p>

<p>Who am I? I am a UX designer, a problem solver and I am here to show you how everything you purchase has a certain good or bad experience to it. I will write in detail about the products I use, give them a rating depending on my experience, and recommend it, if a product is good, but I want you to know that this is my experience with products and the same may not hold good for you, so take this with a pinch of salt and I'd love to hear about how your experience was!</p>
